        "description": "Frontend Developer focused on building complete, user-centered web applications. I specialize in React, TailwindCSS, and Supabase, creating modern UIs with solid logic, clean structure, and good performance. I enjoy crafting products from scratch, where functionality and design go hand in hand. My latest project, TuneBridge, is a full-featured social platform for musicians, including real-time chat, custom profiles, and content sharing — all built independently using modern tools. I value clean, maintainable code, thoughtful UX, and continuous learning. I'm also quick to adopt new technologies when needed."
